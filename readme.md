# Langpad and Lingomio

Langpad and Lingomio are your personal language-learning glossary editors.

**Langpad** is an offline, local-first, static web app, with no login, and no cloud save. Just your glossary.

**Lingomio** (WIP ðŸš§) is an online web app, with user login, and cloud save/sync of your library of glossaries (books).

Both apps are installable as mobile icons on your phone/tablet (PWAs).
